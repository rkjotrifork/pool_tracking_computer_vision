**Game Summary: Rotation Pool Variant**

- Players take turns attempting to legally pocket balls.
- The objective is to score the most points by legally pocketing balls.
- Fouls (marks) are tracked, and accumulating three consecutive fouls results in a penalty.

**Scoring Rules**

- Each legally pocketed ball awards the shooter **its numerical value** (e.g., sinking the 7-ball = 7 points).
- Illegally pocketed balls do not award points and will be placed again on the table
- The player with the most points at the end wins.

**Turn Structure**

1. **Shot Attempt**: The active player takes a shot.
2. **Legal Shot**: A shot is legal if:

- The lowest-numbered ball is hit first and the cue ball is not pocketed

3. **Scoring**:

- If a ball is legally pocketed, the points are added to the shooter's score and the shooter continues their turn.
- If a legal shot is made but the player fails to pocket a ball, the fouls are reset and the game continues.
- If no legal shot is made, a foul is committed and the turn passes to the next player unless "roll-over" is invoked.

**Foul Rules & Penalty**

1. A **foul** (mark) is committed when:

- The cue ball fails to contact any object ball.
- The cue ball is pocketed (The ball will be placed again on the table)
- The lowest-numbered ball is not contacted first.

2. **Three consecutive fouls (marks)** lead to a **-10 point penalty** and reset the foul count.

**Turn Roll-Over Rule**

- If a player fails to make a legal shot, the next player has the option to **force the previous player to shoot again** instead of taking their turn.

**Endgame**

- The game ends when all balls have been pocketed.
- The player with the highest score wins.
